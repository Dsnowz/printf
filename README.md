This custom printf function attempts to emulate the stand printf function. The printf function sends formatted output to stdout. Typically the prinf function includes a format parameter which represents a string text that is sent to the stdout. Optionally, format tags or conversion specifiers may be included to replace that specific tag for a specified output type. These format tags begin with a % sign, followed by a corresponding character which represents a specified output type.
